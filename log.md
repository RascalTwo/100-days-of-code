- Setup E2E testing via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with **_FULL_** code coverage reporting on an [OAuth-using MERN application][together].
  - Tried using more lower-level modules such as [`node-request-interceptor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-request-interceptor) and [`@mswjs/interceptors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mswjs/interceptors) to mock the backend requests, but they didn't work either due to not being detected or returning in invalid responses - [`nock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock) worked smoothly out of the box.
- Collaborated on architectural design of social Recipe-based application & landing page.
- Assisted in implementation of Customizable Images feature of [Image Generalization Finder][igf].
- Researched solutions to obscure Terragrunt error messages.
- Repaired user-authentication in Cocktail-discovery MERN application.
- Setup Toon Boom Harmony development environment with VSCode.
